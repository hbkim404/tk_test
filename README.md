# Pizza Recipes

This project allows the user to scrap pizza recipe information from the [Recetas El Periodico](https://recetas.elperiodico.com/Pizza-busqCate-1.html) website.

Unfinished solution for provided problem during a coding interview.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Generates a `JSON` file with a list of pizza recipes scraped from a speficic static site using `Scrapy`.

- Allows the user to retrieve the information of a pizza recipe given its name. Note that the name has to be passed directly as an argument to the imported function `find_recipe` in `main.py`.

## 📝 General guide

The files of interest are:

- `recipes.py` in `pizza_recipes/pizza_recipes/spiders`
- `find_recipe.py` in `utils`
- `main.py`

The rest are part of the boilerplate generated by `uv` and `scrapy`.

To see the results of this code, simply run `main.py` located in the project's root directory. Settings and arguments are hardcoded for simplicity's sake.
